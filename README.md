# SmartMirror
The Smart Mirror Project is a customizable display system built as a Flask-based web application that dynamically loads and arranges modular components on a sleek, mirror-like interface. The application is designed to show a variety of information—such as the current time, date— creating a modern, minimalist aesthetic.
